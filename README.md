# BlinxAI Agent Framework
##### The BlinxAI Framework open-source code allows users to create AI agents directly in their CLI, with BlinxAI acting as a co-pilot to help build them. The BlinxAI API enables interaction with the AI agents created using the BlinxAI Framework's open-source code.

### üåü Key Features
- Agent Interaction: Use natural language queries to interact with deployed agents.
- Market Analysis: Fetch real-time blockchain data, including market cap, top token holders, and trading activity
- Trend Insights: Discover trending tokens and analyze trading patterns.
- Custom Queries: Execute powerful custom queries for advanced data analysis.
- Bitquery Integration: Seamlessly integrates with Bitquery APIs to fetch blockchain data.

### üõ† Framework Capabilities:
- Token Interaction: Query token metrics such as market cap and top holders.
- Trading Analysis: Identify trending tokens and analyze transaction data.
- Customizable Commands: Easily define custom scripts for agent interaction and deployment.
- Cross-Platform: Fully compatible with modern Node.js environments.

## üöÄ Quick Start
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (>= 16.x)
- npm (or yarn) installed
- A valid Bitquery API key
- read .env.example for rest of the Prerequisites

### Installation 
1. Clone the repository
``` bash 
git clone https://github.com/useBlinxAi/blinx-ai-cli.git
cd blinx-ai-cli
```
2. Install dependencies:
``` bash
npm install
```
3. Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:
 
```bash
PRIVATE_KEYPAIR=<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEYPAIR>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY> 
RPC_ENDPOINT=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com 
BITQUERY_API_KEY=<YOUR_BITQUERY_API_KEY>
```
4. Build the Agent
```bash
npm run build
```

## üöÄ Run the Agent
